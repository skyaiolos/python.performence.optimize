    Description:
    Dictionaries of dictionaries
One last twist on our people database: we can get a little more mileage out of diction-
aries here by using one to represent the database itself. That is, we can use a dictionary
of dictionariesâ€”the outer dictionary is the database, and the nested dictionaries are
the records within it. Rather than a simple list of records, a dictionary-based database
allows us to store and retrieve records by symbolic key:
